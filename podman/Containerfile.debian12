# Configure the debconf frontend.
#
# This image doesn't include whiptail, dialog, nor the readline perl module.
# Therefore, the debconf frontend will be set to 'teletype' to avoid error
# messages about no dialog frontend could be found.
RUN echo 'debconf debconf/frontend select teletype' | debconf-set-selections


# Install the necessary packages.
#
# In addition to the regular Debian base image, a BASIC set of packages from the
# Debian minimal configuration will be installed. After all packages have been
# installed, the apt caches and some log files will be removed to minimize the
# image.
#
# NOTE: An upgrade will be performed to include updates and security fixes of
#       installed packages that received updates in the Debian repository after
#       the upstream image has been created.
#
# NOTE: No syslog daemon will be installed, as systemd's journald should fit
#       most needs. Please file an issue if you think this should be changed.

# Configure systemd.
#
# For running systemd inside a Docker container, some additional tweaks are
# required. For a detailed list see:
#
# https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/09/13/running-systemd-in-a-non-privileged-container/
#
# Additional tweaks will be applied in the final image below.

# To avoid ugly warnings when running this image on a host running systemd, the
# following units will be masked.
#
# NOTE: This will not remove ALL warnings in all Debian releases, but seems to
#       work for stretch.

# Configure systemd.
#
# For running systemd inside a Docker container, some additional tweaks are

STOPSIGNAL SIGRTMIN+3

# The host's cgroup filesystem need's to be mounted (read-only) in the
# container. '/run', '/run/lock' and '/tmp' need to be tmpfs filesystems when
# running the container without 'CAP_SYS_ADMIN'.
#
# NOTE: For running Debian stretch, 'CAP_SYS_ADMIN' still needs to be added, as
#       stretch's version of systemd is not recent enough. Buster will run just
#       fine without 'CAP_SYS_ADMIN'.
VOLUME [ "/sys/fs/cgroup", "/run", "/run/lock", "/tmp" ]

# As this image should run systemd, the default command will be changed to start
# the init system. CMD will be preferred in favor of ENTRYPOINT, so one may
# override it when creating the container to e.g. to run a bash console instead.
CMD [ "/sbin/init" ]
